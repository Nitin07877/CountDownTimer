# CountDownTimer
A countdown timer shows the remaining time until a specific event using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles styling, and JavaScript calculates and updates the time using setInterval() and Date objects. When the timer reaches zero, it can display a message or trigger an action.
